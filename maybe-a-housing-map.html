		===========================
		Gist workflow steps:
		$cd ~/Documents/housing
		$git clone https://gist.github.com/f6c9c651c9cc7e28c4f1.git
		$cd f6c9c651c9cc7e28c4f1
		$vim maybe-a-housing-map.html
		$git add * 
		$git commit
		$git push
		===========================
		TODOs:
		x Get formatting working on main map
		x Test column formatting below that
		x Add bottom maps
		x In Arc, update info windows to always show type of record
		x In Arc, size down the gray boxes to match the size of the black boxes.
		x Fix scrolling bug on large screens.
		x Set up small width-selected snippet to collapse columns, make big map full-width
		x Change extent for Arundel
		x Change the other extents to match surrounding counties. Use comment tags to keep page relatively fast
		x Consider switching small maps to static images - load times are getting pretty laggy
		x Add BSMG branding on top
		x Add main chatter 
		x Add quick bits of chatter over individual maps
		x Add general credit text to the bottom, with a link out to the ESRI version of the map
		- Move from gist to bitbucket and update documentation
		- Start doing all your dev/testing on your mac rather than the server. This will allow scss compilations
		- Get css into scss form using css2sass.herokuapp.com, just to practice good habits. Extract it to its own file
		- Since the small maps are missing some dots, take screenshots of close-in views, then overlay for thoroughness.
			- Arundel
			- Carroll
			- Harford 
			- Howard
		- Also hand-code a legend
		- Iterate with even better static images (preferably gif or png versions of a larger image, scaled down)
		- If time allows, consider trying to link each static image to js that reloads the large map at the appropriate extent
		- Integrate headline fetcher
		- User testing
		- Delete development notes 
		- Create storylink
		- Make ESRI map public
		- Deploy
		- ?

			<h1>Public housing and tax credits in Baltimore</h1>
			<p>The map below shows selected tax credits and public housing sites in the city of Baltimore and its closest suburbs. Some sites -- such as credits for developmentally disabled group homes -- have been omitted for simplicity.</p>

			<div class="columnone">
				<h2>Anne Arundel region</h2>		
				<p>In Anne Arundel County, most public housing developments and non-senior tax credits are clustered on the Annapolis penninsula and along the county's northern border.</p>
				<div class="flatwrap"><img src="arundel.jpg"></div>
				<h2>Howard region</h2>		
				<p>Nearly all of Howard County is rated as having opportunity levels of "very high" or "high." As in most regions, public housing and tax credits are clustered in high-population areas.</p>
				<div class="flatwrap"><img src="howard.jpg"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="columntwo">
				<h2>Carroll region</h2>		
				<p>Carroll County is the most rural of the four counties shown here. It has an abundance of areas rated by analysts as having "low" or "very low" opportunity levels.</p>
				<div class="flatwrap"><img src="carroll.jpg"></div>
				<h2>Harford region</h2>			
				<p>In Harford County, public housing and non-elderly tax credits are largely clustered in the limited-opportunity corridor between Interstate 95 and a heavily traveled rail line.</p>
